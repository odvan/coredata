# coredata

Swift 3.0, Xcode 8.xx

App to show basic skills with Core Data. Imagine some sensor like apple watch or kind of for measuring heart rate.
App is putting each minute new value in Core Data database. Depending upon heart rate the main window show different geometrical figures (NASA stuff for astrounats). Slide at the bottom imitate different pulse (bits per minute).
Secdond view is for database and some graphical representation for last 30 minutes readings.

In theory app should include background mode, but I can't make it since I don't have actual sensor could waking up ios device.

Technologies:
- working with Core Data (writing, fetching);
- seamlessly combining it with tableview;
- creating chart from Core Data fetch request;
- some skills creating bezier path and basic geometrical figures.
